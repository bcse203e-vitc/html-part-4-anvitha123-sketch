      <h2>Why CSS3 Changed Web Design Forever</h2>
      <div class="columns">
        <p>
          CSS3 brought a wave of changes to how websites are styled and built. From gradients and transitions to flexible box layouts, the visual web became more interactive and aesthetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multi-column layouts allow content to flow more like print media, making long-form reading more digestible. Developers can now create magazine-style layouts with just a few lines of code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coupled with properties like `column-count` and `column-gap`, designers gained new freedom. Combined with fixed headers and scrollable sections, modern web pages became both practical and beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          As CSS continues to evolve, understanding its power is essential for front-end developers. Animations, transformations, and responsive design are all pillars of modern interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stay updated with CSS features to keep your designs modern and accessible. Don't underestimate what a few lines of CSS can do to elevate the user experience.
